Operator Precedence
 Example: Calculate Simple Interest
 Take the principal, rate and time from the user and display the simple interest.
 Operator precedence in Python determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Here is 
the precedence of operators in Python, listed in descending order from highest to lowest:
 1. Parentheses: ()
 2. Exponentiation: **
 3. Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus: *, /, //, %
 4. Addition and Subtraction: +, -
 5. Bitwise Shifts: <<, >>
 6. Bitwise AND: &
 7. Bitwise XOR: ^

8. Bitwise OR: |
 9. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, is, is not, in, not in
 10. Logical NOT: not
 11. Logical AND: and
 12. Logical OR: or
 It is important to note that parentheses can be used to override the default precedence and explicitly define 
the order of evaluation
