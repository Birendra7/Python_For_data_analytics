 Data Types
 In Python, data types represent the kind of values that can be stored and manipulated in variables. Python 
provides several built-in data types to handle different types of data. Here are some commonly used data 
types in Python:

 a. Numeric Types
 int: Represents integers (whole numbers) like 3, -7, 100, etc. (In Python 3, the int type has no max limit. You 
can handle values as large as the available memory allows. Python 2 has two integer types, int and long , 
while Python 3 only has int
 float: Represents floating-point numbers (real numbers) with decimal points like 3.14, -0.5, 2.0, etc
 complex: Represents complex numbers with real and imaginary parts, like 2 + 3j, -1 + 0.5j, etc.
 
 b. Text Type
 str: Represents strings of characters enclosed in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). Strings are used to 
store textual data, such as names, sentences, or any sequence of characters. For example: ‘sentence’, 
“mytext”, “abcd”, etc.

 c. Boolean Type
 bool: Represents boolean values, which can be either True or False. Booleans are often used in conditional 
statements and logical operations.

 d. Sequence Types
 list: Represents an ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets ([]). Lists can contain elements of 
different types and can be modified (mutable). For example: thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], mylist = 
[1,2,3,4]
 tuple: Similar to lists, but enclosed in parentheses (()). Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be 
modified after creation and allow duplicate values. For example: thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", 
"apple", "cherry"), mytuple = (1, 2, 2, 3).


 e. Mapping Type
 dict: Represents a collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces ({}) or created using the dict() 
constructor. Dictionaries allow you to store and retrieve values based on unique keys.

For example: 
student = {
 "first_name": "Ally",
 "last_name": "Joy",
 "rollno": 96378
 }
 
 
 f.  Set Types
 set: Represents an unordered collection of unique elements enclosed in curly braces ({}) or created using 
the set() constructor. Sets are useful for performing mathematical set operations, such as union, 
intersection, etc. For example: thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

 e. Other Types
 None: Represents a special value indicating the absence of a value or a null value.
 These are the fundamental data types in Python. However, Python is a dynamic language, allowing you to 
create and work with more complex data structures and custom types using classes and objects. Additionally, 
Python also supports type conversion and type-checking mechanisms to handle different data types 
effectively during the runtime
